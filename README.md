Currently we are using the API-Football which is a restful API for football data and can be found at https://www.api-football.com/.

# Future Plans:
In the future we plan to add cosmetics for the users so they have alternative places to spend their virtual currency.

# How to Use:
just type http://sportsrealm.great-site.net/ into your browser and you should see the login page. 
currently only google sign-in works and once your are signed in you will be redirected to the main page.

<b>Available features: </b>
- Sign-in with your google account
- 3 main pages:
  Home:
    contains scrollable list of matches, when a match is clicked the current status of the match will be displayed on the right.
  Profile:
    Will display the info of the user who is currently signed in. Has two buttons that allow the user to either add or lose 1 betbux
  Shop:
    placeholder for now, in future it will contain betbux balance.
- logout to clear session

# Known Issues:
- Sometimes when signing in, google will return a redirect uri_mismatch(we are currently working on fixing this)
