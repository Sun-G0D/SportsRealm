Sports betting website 

We  want to create an online interactive game that simulates sports betting. I am a huge sports fan and I think that this would be great. In the game, you would have an avatar and you can upgrade your avatar by guessing the correct result of irl sports. If they bet the correct result, they will be awarded an in-game currency that’ll be used to wager or upgrade their avatar or gear. They can also buy properties to gain more money like monopoly. This will incentivize players to wager more money. After a certain number of correct guesses, they will be awarded real life money. If they lose all their money, they will have to reset their account. 

As a massive sports fan and casual gamer, I’ve always wanted to have a video game that bases the game off of in real life results and in game decisions. As for how it’s going to be set up, we will use CSS, HTML, and JavaScript for the front-end framework. For the backend, we will be using Java. We already set up a shared github that’s ready to store the code that we create while we work on this project.
